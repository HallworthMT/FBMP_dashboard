# Forest Bird Monitoring Project Dashboard 

## An Innovative Long-Term Study

Initiated in 1989, the Forest Bird Monitoring Project (FBMP) is now one of the continent’s longest-running studies of forest bird population trends. We’re gathering data across a broad range of forest types. While numerous studies have documented declines songbirds inhabiting fragmented landscapes, few monitor birds in protected undisturbed forests in the Northeast. With troubling losses of forest habitats in Latin America and the Caribbean, where many of these birds spend the winter, it becomes critical to understand how these changes affect – over the long term – diversity and abundance on breeding grounds.
